## Tasks

1. Implement a stack with operations Push, Pop, Max, where each operation takes constant
time to complete : O(c)

2. Implement a queue with operations Push, Pop, Max, where each operation takes constant
time to complete : O(c)

3. You are given an input string as a sequence of brackets of different types `'(', ')', '[', ']', '{', ‘}’`.  
- We need to implement an algorithm that will check if the sequence is correct, i.e. there is a
closing bracket for each opening bracket.  
For example  
`‘([{}])’` and `‘()()’` are correct, `‘[)’` and `‘[(])’` are not.  
The algorithm should be of O(n) complexity
where n is the length of the input string.
